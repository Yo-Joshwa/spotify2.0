# Spotify2.0
# Project Overview
  This project is a simple Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the basic design and functionality of the Spotify web player, allowing users to interact with    a music player interface. Users can play, pause, and skip songs, as well as see details like the track name, artist, and album art.

# Features:
  1. Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
  2. Music Controls: Users can play, pause, skip to the next or previous track, and seek through the current track using a progress bar.
  3. Track Information: Display of track details including song title, artist, and album cover.
  4. Playlist: Basic playlist functionality that allows users to see the list of tracks and select the song to play.

# Tech Stack
  1. HTML: For creating the structure of the app.
  2. CSS: For styling the user interface and making it responsive.
  3. JavaScript: For adding interactivity, such as music controls and dynamic updates.
